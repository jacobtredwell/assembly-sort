# assembly-sort
 bubbleSort and insertionSort algorithms written in ARM assembly language - uses C++ menu driver to call external functions


Menu driver program in C that executes the following menu. The purpose of the assignment is demonstrate the calling Assembly language macros from C++.   only loads via the menu.

input file "input.txt" (200,000 random integers). I made C++ file that randomly generates the 200,000 integers and outputs to a file.

saves the array to its respective text file (i.e. "c_output.txt" and "a_output.txt") to verify sorting algorithms work.
